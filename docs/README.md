Squirrel sums is a game that hopes to more gently and intuitively introduce children to the concept of addition with the help of a see-saw visualization - which is a greatly underutilized tool.

### [See it in action!](https://youtu.be/SeQGfVNL2yY)

### It is my hope that...
- **Students** will find playing with the see-saw visualizer engaging
- **Educators** will find it easy to add custom game configurations
- **Developers** will find the stack easy to reproduce and deploy
