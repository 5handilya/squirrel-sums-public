# Squirrel Sums
My submission for Comini Learning's [Addition Game hiring challenge](https://github.com/CominiLearning/Hiring-Challenge-Build-in-Public)

Squirrel sums is a game that hopes to more gently and intuitively introduce children to the concept of addition with the help of a see-saw visualization - which is a greatly underutilized tool.

This was my first web development project, and I learned the ropes making this full stack project in about two weeks. I later deployed it on a Google Cloud Platform VM, and now on my own computer with a cloudflare tunnel + nginx (among other sites). If the link doesnt work, I apologize! I am probably in a blackout :|

### [See it in action!](https://youtu.be/SeQGfVNL2yY)

### It is my hope that...
- **Students** will find playing with the see-saw visualizer engaging
- **Educators** will find it easy to add custom game configurations
- **Developers** will find the stack easy to reproduce and deploy
